# Themed

A customizable dynamic theme extension for Firefox, feels more in control...

## What it Offers

### 5 Categories to choose from:

- Natural
- Animals
- Plain
- Patterns
- Graffiti

### Private Mode

Gone incognito? Yeah it feels different...so why the same theme for different experience!?
Have randomly selected different themes from a set of private themes for your private experience.

### Day and Night Mode

So you work at night!? Most of us do and most probably you are having a night mode theme addon right now in
your firefox. But having different addons for different set of work kinda makes it messy in browser.
What if you have a dedicated mode you can switch to? :smiley:

### Weather Mode

Nothing more exciting can happen than having themes change automatically with change in weather!!

### Quotes Mode

So you are keen on thoughts of famous people or you're just a motivation seeker cause it boosts your productivity?
Well, again no need to have different addon for this purpose.

### Custom Themes

Nothing seems fine till now? Maybe some customization will make you happy in this case. Period. End of Story!
